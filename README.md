# Simplified Markers for Google Maps API

## Concepts

### Attributes

Marker attributes are all the different values that make
up the marker's appearance and are generally passed on to the google maps
implementation. They are either passed to the constructor or can be set as
properties on the marker-object. Any change to a marker-attribute will
be immediately written to the google maps advanced marker.

- **all markers:** position, collisionBehaviour, draggable, ...
- **pinview markers:** background, borderColor, glyph, ...
- **html markers:** element, classes
- **additional attributes:** where it makes sense, we will introduce more
  attributes that control a combination of aspects in the maps-api (e.g. the
  `color` attribute which controls all other color-attributes) or additional
  features not present in the maps api (e.g. marker shapes).

### Static and Dynamic Attributes

Every attribute can be specified either as a direct value
(e.g. `marker.color = 'green'`) or as a function, that receives a state-object
and can use that to compute the final values
(`marker.color = ({map}) => map.zoom > 12 ? 'green' : 'blue'`).

For dynamic attributes the computed value is updated with every change to
the state. This state contains information about the map (all camera
parameters and current map bounds), the marker (interaction state, map
visibility, ...), the current value of all other attributes and user-specified
data.

### Adding new Attributes

To add a new attribute

1. add the attribute name to `attributeKeys`
2. add the name and type to the StaticAttributes type definition
3. add declarations for the attribute to the Marker class and the
   ComputedMarkerAttributes class
4. implement the attribute logic within the `update()` function

## Code Organization

- `/`: contains `index.html` and configuration-files
- `/scripts`: this is the place for utility scripts, mostly written in [zx][]
- `/src`: the typescript source-root. At this level, the
  playground-application entrypoint is located
- `/src/lib`: contains everything that will eventually become
  the markers-library
- `/src/editor`: contains all the source-files for editor-specific
  functionality (monaco setup etc.)
- `/examples`: contains the examples-index-page and source-files for all
  examples. The typescript files here should all follow the conventions for
  examples below. For the examples index-page, these files are packaged
  into examples.json by the `build:examples` npm task (see
  `/scripts/update-examples.mjs`)
- `/examples/lib`: contains the typescript declaration-files used by the
  editor and referenced by the examples. Those files are generated by
  `npm run build:dts` from the library files in `src/lib`
- `/types` is for additional typescript declarations

## scripts, npm-tasks and deployment

The published version of this is hosted on google cloud storage and available
here: https://storage.ubidev.net/marker-api-playground

Be aware that people outside ubilabs have access to the deployed version
and while we can actively develop and publish new versions, the deployed
version should always be manually checked after a deployment.

The following supporting scripts and tasks are available:

- `npm start`: starts the vite dev-server (this will also run the `build:dts`
  and `build:examples` tasks)
- `npm run build:dts`: compiles all typescript-files in `./src/lib`
  into corresponding declaration files in `./examples/lib`
- `npm run build:examples`: runs the `script/update-examples.mjs` script to
  update the examples index in `./examples/examples.json`. The index is
  loaded in `examples.html` to render the list of examples
- `npm run build`: runs all `build:*` tasks followed by `vite build` to
  generate the full application in `./dist`
- `npm run preview`: runs the full build and starts the vite preview server
  to review everything as if it were in production
- `npm run deploy`: deploys the application to google cloud storage bucket
  `gs://storage.ubidev.net/marker-api-playground`

### deployment process

We're deploying from our local repository, so first of all, make sure that
a) you are in the main branch, b) it is up to date and c) you don't have any
uncomitted changes:

    git pull
    git status

Next, create a new version and push it to github. Which kind of version to
create depends on the type of changes since the last deployment.

    npm version major
    # or: npm version minor / npm version patch

This will update the package.json and create a new commit as well as a
version-tag. To push the new commit and release-tag to github:

    git push ; git push --tags

Now, run a preview build and verify it's working as intended:

    npm run preview

Deploy to production:

    npm run deploy

Finally, document the API changes in the [Marker-API Documentation][marker-doc].
You can see all commits since the last release using:

    git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline
